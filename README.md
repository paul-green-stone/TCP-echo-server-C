# TCP-echo-server-C

A simple TCP echo-server implemented in C

## main

The `main` branch contains the basic theory and concepts about TCP sockets. This should be enough to understand the underlying principles that are applied in the other branches.

## IPv4

The [`IPv4`](https://github.com/paul-green-stone/TCP-echo-server-C/tree/IPv4) branch focuses on implementing TCP socket communication using the IPv4 protocol.

## IPv6

The [`IPv6`](https://github.com/paul-green-stone/TCP-echo-server-C/tree/IPv6) branch focuses on implementing TCP socket communication using the IPv6 protocol.

## generic 

The [`generic`](https://github.com/paul-green-stone/TCP-echo-server-C/tree/generic) branch provides a more generic approach to TCP socket programming, without being tied to a specific IP protocol version
